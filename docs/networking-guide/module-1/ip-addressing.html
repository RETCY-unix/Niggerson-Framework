                 INTRODUCTION TO IP ADDRESSING
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Internet Protocol (IP) addressing</strong> constitutes the fundamental mechanism by which
                devices are identified and located within IP-based networks. Every device participating in network
                communication must possess a unique IP address that distinguishes it from all other devices within
                the same network scope. This addressing system forms the backbone of all internetwork communication,
                from local area networks to the global Internet.
            </p>

            <p>
                IP addresses serve two primary functions: <strong>host identification</strong> and
                <strong>location addressing</strong>. Unlike physical MAC addresses which are permanently assigned
                to hardware, IP addresses are logically assigned and can be changed based on network configuration.
                This logical assignment enables hierarchical network design, efficient routing, and flexible network
                reorganization.
            </p>

                    and as a locator address for routing purposes.

                 IPv4 ADDRESSING
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>IPv4 Addressing</h2>

            <p>
                Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) has served as the primary addressing system since the early
                development of internetworking. An IPv4 address consists of 32 bits, typically represented as
                four decimal octets separated by periods (dotted-decimal notation). Each octet represents 8 bits,
                with values ranging from 0 to 255.
            </p>

            <div class="technical-block">
                <div class="technical-block-title">IPv4 Address Structure</div>
                <pre>
IPv4 Address Length: 32 bits (4 bytes)
Total Possible Addresses: 2^32 = 4,294,967,296

Binary Format:     11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001
Decimal Format:    192.168.1.1

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

            <h3>Binary to Decimal Conversion</h3>

            <p>
                Understanding binary-to-decimal conversion is essential for network operations. Each bit position
                in an octet represents a power of 2, from 2^7 (128) to 2^0 (1). Converting binary to decimal
                involves summing the values of all positions where the bit is set to 1.
            </p>

            <div class="diagram">
                BINARY POSITIONAL VALUES (8-bit octet):

                Position: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
                Value: 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
                === == == == = = = =

                Example: Convert 11000000 to decimal

                Position: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
                Bit: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
                Value: 128 64 -- -- -- -- -- --

                Sum: 128 + 64 = 192

                Therefore: 11000000 (binary) = 192 (decimal)
            </div>

            <h3>IPv4 Address Classes</h3>

            <p>
                The original IPv4 addressing scheme defined five address classes (A through E) based on the
                leading bits of the first octet. This classful addressing system allocated addresses in fixed
                blocks, which proved inefficient for many organizations.

            <h3>Private IP Address Ranges</h3>

            <p>
                RFC 1918 defines three address ranges reserved for private network use. These addresses are not
                routable on the public Internet and can be freely used within private networks. Network Address
                Translation (NAT) enables devices with private addresses to communicate with public Internet
                resources.

                 SUBNET MASKS
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Subnet Masks</h2>

            <p>
                A <strong>subnet mask</strong> is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into network
                and host portions. The mask uses consecutive 1s to identify network bits and consecutive 0s
                to identify host bits. The subnet mask determines which portion of an IP address identifies
                the network and which portion identifies the specific host within that network.
            </p>

            <div class="diagram">

            <p>
                The AND operation between an IP address and its subnet mask yields the network address.
                All hosts sharing the same network address belong to the same IP network and can communicate
                directly without routing.

            <h3>CIDR Notation</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)</strong> provides a more flexible method for
                specifying network addresses than classful addressing. CIDR notation appends a forward slash
                and the number of network bits to the IP address.

                 IPv6 ADDRESSING
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>IPv6 Addressing</h2>

            <p>
                Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) was developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4 address
                space and to provide improvements in routing, security, and auto-configuration capabilities.
                An IPv6 address consists of 128 bits, providing a vastly larger address space than IPv4.
            </p>

            <div class="technical-block">
                <div class="technical-block-title">IPv6 Address Space</div>
                <pre>
IPv6 Address Length: 128 bits (16 bytes)
Total Possible Addresses: 2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456

Comparison:
  IPv4: 4.3 x 10^9 addresses
  IPv6: 3.4 x 10^38 addresses

That is approximately 340 undecillion addresses, or enough to assign:
  - 100 addresses per atom on Earth's surface
  - 4.8 x 10^28 addresses per human on Earth
</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>IPv6 Address Format</h3>

            <p>
                IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.
                Each group represents 16 bits (2 bytes) of the address.
            </p>

            <h3>IPv6 Address Simplification Rules</h3>

            <p>
                IPv6 addresses can be simplified using two rules to reduce representation length:
            </p>

            <div class="technical-block">
                <div class="technical-block-title">Simplification Rules</div>
                <pre>
RULE 1: Leading zeros within each group can be omitted

  2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:0000:0000:0001
  2001: db8:   0:  42:   0:   0:   0:   1

RULE 2: Consecutive groups of all zeros can be replaced with ::
        (This can only be done ONCE per address)

  2001:db8:0:42:0:0:0:1
  2001:db8:0:42::1

Full simplification example:
  Original:   2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
  After R1:   2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1

            <h2>IP Address Assignment Methods</h2>

            <h3>Static Assignment</h3>

            <p>
                Static IP addressing involves manually configuring an IP address on each device. This method
                provides absolute control over addressing but requires manual administration and documentation.
                Static addressing is typically used for servers, network infrastructure, and devices requiring
                consistent addressing.
            </p>

            <h3>Dynamic Assignment (DHCP)</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</strong> automates IP address assignment from
                a configured pool. A DHCP server leases addresses to clients for a specified duration, reducing
                administrative overhead and enabling efficient address utilization.

                        <p>
                            IPv6 supports <strong>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)</strong>, which enables
                            devices
                            to configure their own addresses without a DHCP server. The device generates its interface
                            ID
                            (typically from its MAC address) and combines it with the network prefix advertised by
                            routers.
