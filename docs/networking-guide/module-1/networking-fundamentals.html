                 DEFINITION OF NETWORKING
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Definition and Core Concepts</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Computer networking</strong> is the practice of interconnecting computing devices to enable
                the exchange of data and resources. At its fundamental level, a network consists of two or more
                computing devices connected through a transmission medium, utilizing standardized protocols to
                facilitate communication. This definition, while technically accurate, barely scratches the surface
                of the complex systems that constitute modern networking infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
                A network, in operational terms, is a communications system designed to transmit digital information
                between endpoints with reliability, security, and efficiency. Every component within a network
                serves a specific purpose in the data transmission chain, from the physical cables carrying electrical
                signals to the software protocols governing how that data is formatted, addressed, and routed.
            </p>

            <div class="definition-block">
                <div class="definition-term">Network</div>
                <div class="definition-desc">
                    A system of interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources
                    through defined communication protocols over physical or wireless transmission media.

            </div>

            <h3>Fundamental Network Components</h3>

            <p>
                Every network, regardless of scale or complexity, comprises several essential components that
                work in concert to enable communication:
            </p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Component</th>
                        <th>Function</th>

                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>End Devices</td>
                        <td>Generate and consume network data; serve as source and destination of communications</td>

            </table>

            <!-- ============================================
                 NETWORK TYPES
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Network Classification by Geographic Scope</h2>

            <p>
                Networks are classified primarily by their geographic coverage area and the scope of connectivity
                they provide. Understanding these classifications is essential for network planning, security
                considerations, and resource allocation.
            </p>

            <h3>Personal Area Network (PAN)</h3>

            <p>
                A Personal Area Network encompasses the smallest network scope, typically extending no more than
                a few meters around an individual user. PANs connect personal devices within immediate proximity,
                enabling data synchronization and resource sharing between a user's devices.
            </p>

            <div class="technical-block">
                <div class="technical-block-title">PAN Specifications</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong> Typically 1-10 meters</li>
                    <li><strong>Technologies:</strong> Bluetooth, USB, Infrared, NFC</li>
                    <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> Varies; Bluetooth 5.0 supports up to 2 Mbps</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Wireless headsets, wearables, peripheral connectivity</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Considerations:</strong> Proximity-based pairing, encryption required</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Local Area Network (LAN)</h3>

            <p>
                Local Area Networks represent the most common network type in organizational deployments. A LAN
                connects devices within a limited geographic area such as a building, office floor, or campus.
                LANs are characterized by high bandwidth, low latency, and single administrative domain control.
            </p>

            <p>
                The defining characteristics of a LAN include direct ownership of the network infrastructure,
                meaning the organization controls all switching and routing equipment within the LAN boundary.
                This ownership enables granular control over network policies, security measures, and performance
                optimization.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h3>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h3>

            <p>
                Metropolitan Area Networks span a geographic region larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN,
                typically covering a city or metropolitan region. MANs interconnect multiple LANs within a
                defined metropolitan boundary, often utilizing high-speed fiber optic infrastructure.
            </p>

            <p>
                MANs serve critical functions in modern urban infrastructure. Municipal governments, educational
                systems spanning multiple campuses, and healthcare networks with distributed facilities commonly
                deploy MAN architectures to maintain high-bandwidth connectivity between sites while retaining
                network ownership.
            </p>

            <div class="technical-block">
                <div class="technical-block-title">MAN Specifications</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong> 5 to 50 kilometers (city-wide)</li>
                    <li><strong>Technologies:</strong> Fiber optic, Metro Ethernet, SONET/SDH</li>
                    <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps typical</li>
                    <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> May be private, municipal, or carrier-operated</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> City networks, campus interconnection, regional ISP</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h3>

            <p>
                Wide Area Networks provide connectivity across extensive geographic distances, potentially
                spanning countries or continents. Unlike LANs where organizations own the infrastructure, WANs
                typically rely on telecommunications carriers to provide the underlying transport services.
            </p>

            <p>
                The fundamental distinction between WAN and other network types lies in the traversal of
                public telecommunications infrastructure. When data must travel beyond the boundaries of
                organizationally-owned infrastructure, it enters the WAN domain. This introduces considerations
                regarding latency, bandwidth costs, security, and service level agreements with carriers.
            </p>

                 NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Network Topologies</h2>

            <p>
                Network topology describes the arrangement of nodes and connections within a network. Topology
                can be examined from two perspectives: <strong>physical topology</strong>, which describes the
                actual layout of cables and devices, and <strong>logical topology</strong>, which describes how
                data flows through the network regardless of physical arrangement.
            </p>

            <h3>Bus Topology</h3>

            <p>
                In a bus topology, all devices connect to a single backbone cable, also known as the bus. Data
                transmitted by any device propagates along the entire length of the bus, and all devices receive
                the transmission simultaneously. Only the intended recipient processes the data; all other devices
                ignore it.
            </p>

                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple installation, minimal cabling required</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Single point of failure, collision domain spans entire network

            <h3>Star Topology</h3>

            <p>
                Star topology represents the dominant configuration in modern LAN deployments. All devices
                connect to a central node, typically a switch or hub. All traffic flows through this central
                device, which forwards data only to the intended destination port.
            </p>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Ring Topology</h3>

            <p>
                In ring topology, each device connects to exactly two neighboring devices, forming a circular
                data path. Data travels in one direction (or both in dual-ring configurations) around the ring
                until it reaches its destination. Token-passing protocols commonly govern access in ring networks.
            </p>

            <h3>Mesh Topology</h3>

            <p>
                Mesh topology provides multiple paths between any two nodes in the network. In a <strong>full
                    mesh</strong>,
                every device connects directly to every other device. In a <strong>partial mesh</strong>, some
                devices connect to multiple devices while others maintain fewer connections. Mesh topologies
                provide exceptional redundancy and fault tolerance.

            <h3>Hybrid Topology</h3>

            <p>
                Hybrid topologies combine elements of multiple topology types to meet specific requirements.
                Modern enterprise networks almost universally employ hybrid approaches, utilizing star topology
                at the access layer, connected via mesh or partial mesh at the distribution and core layers.

                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Network Communication Models</h2>

            <p>
                The manner in which network devices interact and share resources fundamentally shapes network
                architecture decisions. Two primary models dominate network design: client-server and peer-to-peer.
            </p>

            <h3>Client-Server Architecture</h3>

            <p>
                Client-server architecture defines a clear separation between service providers (servers) and
                service consumers (clients). Servers maintain resources and provide services upon request; clients
                initiate requests and consume the provided services. This model centralizes resources, simplifies
                management, and enables scalable service delivery.
            </p>

            <div class="diagram">
                CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE:

                [SERVER]

                - Clients REQUEST services from servers
                - Servers RESPOND with requested data/services
                - Centralized resource management
                - Scalable through server clustering

            </div>

            <h3>Peer-to-Peer Architecture</h3>

            <p>
                Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks distribute resources across participating nodes equally. Each device
                functions simultaneously as both client and server, providing and consuming resources. P2P
                topology eliminates single points of failure but introduces challenges in management, security,
                and resource discovery.

                            <h2>Data Transmission Fundamentals</h2>

                            <p>
                                Understanding how data traverses a network requires examination of the fundamental
                                concepts
                                governing digital communication: how data is encoded into signals, how signals are
                                transmitted,
                                and how transmission is coordinated between devices.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Data Encoding</h3>

                            <p>
                                Before transmission, digital data must be encoded into a format suitable for the
                                transmission
                                medium. For electrical transmission over copper, data is encoded as voltage level
                                variations.
                                For optical transmission over fiber, data is encoded as light pulse presence or absence.
                                For
                                wireless transmission, data is encoded through modulation of radio frequency signals.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Bandwidth</strong> represents the maximum theoretical capacity of a network

                                rate, which is always less than or equal to bandwidth due to protocol overhead,
                                congestion, and
                                other factors.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Latency</strong> measures the time delay for data to traverse from source to
                                destination.
                                Total latency comprises multiple components: propagation delay (signal travel time
                                through media),
                                transmission delay (time to push bits onto wire), processing delay (device processing
                                time), and
                                queuing delay (time waiting in device buffers).
                            </p>

                            <pre><code>Total Latency = Propagation + Transmission + Processing + Queuing

Example Calculation:
- Distance: 100 km fiber link
- Propagation: ~0.5 ms (light speed in fiber ~200,000 km/s)
- Transmission: Minimal for high-speed links
- Processing: ~0.1 ms per hop (varies by device)
- Queuing: Variable based on congestion

Typical end-to-end latency: 1-5 ms for local network
                            50-150 ms for intercontinental</code></pre>
