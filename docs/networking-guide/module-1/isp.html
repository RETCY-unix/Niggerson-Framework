                 INTRODUCTION TO ISPs
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>
                An <strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</strong> is an organization that provides services
                for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet. ISPs form the commercial backbone of
                Internet connectivity, operating the infrastructure that enables end users and organizations
                to connect to the global network. Understanding ISP operations is essential for network planning,
                troubleshooting connectivity issues, and comprehending how data traverses the Internet.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Internet is not a single network but rather an interconnection of thousands of independent
                networks operated by ISPs worldwide. These networks must cooperate and exchange traffic through
                defined relationships to create the unified global network we call the Internet. The technical
                and business relationships between ISPs fundamentally shape Internet performance, resilience,
                and accessibility.
            </p>

            <!-- ============================================
                 ISP HIERARCHY
                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>ISP Tier Classification</h2>

            <p>
                ISPs are classified into tiers based on their role in the Internet hierarchy and their
                interconnection relationships with other providers. This tier system reflects both network
                size and the provider's position within the global routing infrastructure.
            </p>

            <h3>Tier 1 ISPs</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Tier 1 providers</strong> represent the apex of the Internet hierarchy. These organizations
                operate massive global networks with direct connections to every part of the Internet. The defining
                characteristic of a Tier 1 provider is that they can reach every other network on the Internet
                without purchasing transit from any other provider. Tier 1 networks exchange traffic exclusively
                through settlement-free peering agreements with other Tier 1 providers.
            </p>

            <div class="technical-block">
                <div class="technical-block-title">Tier 1 ISP Characteristics</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global Reach:</strong> Direct or peered connectivity to all Internet destinations</li>
                    <li><strong>Transit-Free:</strong> Does not purchase transit from any other provider</li>
                    <li><strong>Peering:</strong> Settlement-free peering with all other Tier 1 providers</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Operates intercontinental backbone networks</li>
                    <li><strong>AS Numbers:</strong> Manages significant IP address and AS resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Lumen (CenturyLink), NTT, Cogent, GTT, Telia</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Tier 2 ISPs</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Tier 2 providers</strong> operate regional or national networks that require a combination
                of peering and transit to reach all Internet destinations. These ISPs have extensive networks
                but lack the global reach of Tier 1 providers. They peer with some networks directly while
                purchasing transit from Tier 1 providers for destinations they cannot reach through peering.
            </p>

            <div class="technical-block">
                <div class="technical-block-title">Tier 2 ISP Characteristics</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regional/National Scope:</strong> Significant but not global infrastructure</li>
                    <li><strong>Transit Required:</strong> Purchases transit for some destinations</li>
                    <li><strong>Peering Active:</strong> Maintains numerous peering relationships</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Base:</strong> Serves smaller ISPs and enterprise customers</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Regional carriers, national ISPs without global backbone</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Tier 3 ISPs</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Tier 3 providers</strong> are typically local or retail ISPs that purchase all their
                transit from larger providers. These organizations focus on last-mile connectivity, delivering
                Internet access to residential and small business customers within a specific geographic area.
                Tier 3 ISPs do not typically peer with other networks; they rely entirely on their upstream
                transit providers for Internet connectivity.
            </p>

                 ============================================ -->
            <h2>Interconnection Types</h2>

            <p>
                ISPs interconnect through two primary relationship types: <strong>peering</strong> and
                <strong>transit</strong>. Understanding these relationships is critical for comprehending
                Internet routing, performance optimization, and traffic engineering.
            </p>

            <h3>Peering</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Peering</strong> is an agreement between two networks to exchange traffic between
                their respective customers directly. In a peering arrangement, neither party pays the other
                for traffic exchange. Peering is typically established when both parties benefit roughly
                equally from the direct traffic exchange, reducing the need for transit.
            </p>

            <div class="definition-block">
                <div class="definition-term">Settlement-Free Peering</div>
                <div class="definition-desc">
                    An interconnection agreement where two networks exchange traffic without monetary payment.
                    Each party carries traffic destined for its own customers at its own expense. This arrangement
                    assumes roughly equal benefit to both parties.
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Peering can be established through two methods:
            </p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>

                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Private Peering</td>
                        <td>Direct physical connection between two networks</td>
                        <td>Dedicated capacity, higher cost, greater control</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Public Peering</td>
                        <td>Connection through an Internet Exchange Point (IXP)</td>
                        <td>Shared facility, lower cost, access to multiple peers</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Transit</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Transit</strong> is a paid service where one network pays another for access to the
                entire Internet. The transit provider agrees to forward traffic from the customer network to
                any destination on the Internet and to accept traffic from anywhere on the Internet destined
                for the customer. Transit providers announce the customer's routes to their peers and upstream
                providers.

                            An <strong>Internet Exchange Point (IXP)</strong> is a physical location where multiple
                            networks interconnect to exchange traffic. IXPs provide shared switching infrastructure
                            that enables efficient peering between many networks at reduced cost compared to
                            establishing
                            individual private peering connections.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)</strong> transmits data over existing copper telephone
                            infrastructure. DSL utilizes frequency ranges above voice frequencies, enabling simultaneous
                            voice and data transmission. Performance degrades with distance from the central office,
                            limiting practical deployment range.

                        <h2>ISP Routing Operations</h2>

                        <p>
                            ISPs utilize the <strong>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong> to exchange routing
                            information with peers and customers. BGP enables ISPs to advertise the networks they
                            can reach and to learn routes from other networks. The aggregation of all BGP-exchanged
                            routes forms the global Internet routing table.

                            An <strong>Autonomous System (AS)</strong> is a collection of IP networks under the control
                            of a single administrative entity that presents a common routing policy to the Internet.
                            Each AS is identified by a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN), assigned by Regional
                            Internet Registries.
